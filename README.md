This is a full RESTful API linked to an extensive database detailing everything about the Pokémon main game series.

Rules:
  - Locally cache resources and images when ever you request them.
  - Do not spam the entire service to scrape all the data at once - use the paginated pages.
  - Use the correct user-agent header in API requests.
  - Be nice and friendly to your fellow PokéAPI developer.

I called my data from pokemon API (http://pokeapi.co/)
and as you can see, by choosing your favorite number, type it in input and click the "Click" button,
created a table with pokemons avatar and their names, types and weights.
I know ReactJS short time and I've not been able to create a search box because of the shortage of time.
